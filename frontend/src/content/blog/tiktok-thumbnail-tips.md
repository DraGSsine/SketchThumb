## Master TikTok Cover Images That Get Noticed

TikTok moves FAST. Your cover image (the thumbnail viewers see first) needs to stop people mid-scroll. Unlike YouTube, these thumbnails work differently. Here's how to nail them using **sketching thumbnails** and an **AI thumbnail maker**.

### Tip #1: Focus on a Single Strong Emotion

TikTok thrives on emotional response. Your thumbnail should preview the emotional journey.

**How to do it:**
- When **sketching thumbnails**, exaggerate facial expressions (surprise, joy, shock)
- Capture the peak emotional moment from your video
- Use your **AI thumbnail maker** with prompts like "extreme surprise face" or "genuine laughter moment"

### Tip #2: Add visual Intrigue or Mystery

Curiosity makes people stop scrolling. Create a "what's happening here?" moment.

**How to do it:**
- Sketch unusual juxtapositions (tiny person holding giant object)
- Show the "middle" of an action rather than the beginning or end
- Create visual puzzles that can only be solved by watching
- Use your **AI thumbnail maker** to refine these concepts with prompts like "intriguing perspective" or "unexpected moment"

### Tip #3: vibrant, High-Contrast Colors

TikTok's interface is already colorful. Stand out with strategic color choices.

**How to do it:**
- Use color psychology in your **sketching thumbnails** (red for excitement, blue for calm)
- Plan for complementary color pairs that pop (purple/yellow, blue/orange)
- Ask your **AI thumbnail maker** to "use vibrant TikTok-friendly colors"
- Avoid muddy or desaturated colors that get lost in the feed

### Tip #4: Clean, Minimal Text (If Any)

Unlike YouTube, most TikTok thumbnails work better with minimal or no text.

**How to do it:**
- If using text, limit to 1-3 impactful words
- When **sketching thumbnails**, make text large and integrated with the image
- Use your **AI thumbnail maker** with simple text prompts like "ONE WORD bold text integrated with image"
- Consider text as a graphic element rather than just information

### Tip #5: Optimize for vertical Format

TikTok is vertical-first. Design specifically for this format.

**How to do it:**
- Sketch in 9:16 ratio from the start
- Place key elements in the center 50% of the frame
- Remember that app elements may cover portions of your thumbnail
- Tell your **AI thumbnail maker** specifically "optimize for TikTok vertical format"

With these tips, your TikTok thumbnails will grab attention in the endless scroll. Start with quick concept sketches before creating the final version with an AI tool or traditional design software.
