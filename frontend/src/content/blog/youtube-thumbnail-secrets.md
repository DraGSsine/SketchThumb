## Make Your YouTube videos Stand Out

YouTube is crowded! How do you get people to click *your* video? A killer thumbnail is key. Even better, you can plan it by **sketching thumbnails** first. Then, use these secrets (and maybe an **AI thumbnail maker**) to bring your sketch to life.

### Secret 1: Show, Don't Just Tell (with Emotion!)

*   **What it means:** Instead of just text, show what the video is about. Even better, show emotion! A surprised face, a frustrated look, or pure excitement grabs attention.
*   **Sketching it:** Quickly draw stick figures or simple faces showing the emotion. Where will the face be? Big or small? Sketching helps you place it right.
*   **AI Maker Tip:** Tell the **AI thumbnail maker** the emotion you want (e.g., "surprised face looking at a computer screen").

### Secret 2: Big, Bold, Easy-to-Read Text

*   **What it means:** People scan thumbnails fast, often on phones. Use minimal text (3-5 words max), make it HUGE, and choose a font that's super clear.
*   **Sketching it:** Block out where the text will go. Does it cover the important parts of the image? Is there enough contrast so it pops? Try different placements in your sketch.
*   **AI Maker Tip:** Specify "bold, readable text" and provide the short phrase you sketched out.

### Secret 3: Contrast is Your Friend

*   **What it means:** Make the important stuff stand out! Use bright colors against dark backgrounds, or vice versa. Outline your main subject or text.
*   **Sketching it:** Use shading or simple color notes (like "Bright Yellow Text" vs. "Dark Blue BG") to plan your contrast. Does the main element pop out even in a simple sketch?
*   **AI Maker Tip:** Ask the **AI thumbnail maker** for "high contrast" or specify colors like "bright subject on dark background".

Start by **sketching thumbnails** incorporating these secrets. It makes the final design process, whether manual or using an **AI thumbnail maker**, much easier and more effective!
